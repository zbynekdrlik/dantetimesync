- Update badge on tray icon: orange dot in corner when new version available
- Start Menu shortcut: "Dante Time Sync" now appears in Windows Start Menu for easy access

### Fixed
- Tray icon now visually indicates when update is available (persistent badge)

## [1.7.1] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed
- Tray menu now shows "Start Service" when service is stopped (was always showing "Stop Service")
- Restart Service menu item is disabled when service is already stopped

## [1.7.0] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- Automatic update check: tray app periodically checks GitHub for new versions (every 6 hours)
- Update notification: toast notification when new version is available
- Upgrade menu item: one-click upgrade via PowerShell IRM from tray menu
- Version comparison logic to detect newer releases

### Dependencies
- Added reqwest HTTP client for GitHub API communication

## [1.6.4] - 2025-12-27

### Fixed
- Jitter estimator now persists across NTP step corrections (was incorrectly clearing on each step)

## [1.6.3] - 2025-12-27

### Added
- Adaptive jitter smoothing for high-jitter systems (Realtek NICs, Hyper-V hosts)
- JitterEstimator measures stddev of drift rate over 30-sample window
- Dynamic EMA alpha: 0.3 for low jitter (<2 µs/s) → 0.1 for high jitter (>8 µs/s)
- Jitter logging every 50 samples when adaptive smoothing is active

### Changed
- EMA alpha now adapts based on measured jitter level instead of fixed value

## [1.5.6] - 2025-12-26

### Added
- PTP offline detection: graceful fallback to NTP-only sync when PTP masters are unavailable
- Orange tray icon for NTP-only mode (PTP offline)
- Toast notifications for PTP offline/restored transitions
- NTP failure tracking with tray notifications when NTP server is unreachable
- Windows Add/Remove Programs registration in installer
- Unit tests for PTP offline detection

### Changed
- Tightened NTP step threshold from 2000µs to 500µs for better UTC alignment

### Fixed
- Application no longer hangs when PTP Dante masters are switched off

## [1.5.5] - 2024-12-24

### Added
- Grandmaster switch detection with sync source tracking
- Soft reset on grandmaster switch to preserve learned frequency
- Unit tests for sync source change detection
- CI coverage reporting with Codecov integration
- Npcap SDK checksum verification in CI
- Unit tests for net.rs (interface selection, socket binding, wireless detection)
- Unit tests for clock/windows.rs (PPM conversion math, adjustment calculation)
- Unit tests for net_pcap.rs (timestamp conversion, packet structure validation)
- Unit tests for net_winsock.rs (QPC math, control message parsing, constants)

### Changed
- Improved installer version handling (dynamic extraction from binary)
- Increased codecov patch target to 70%

### Fixed
- RwLock poison handling in IPC server (prevents service crash)
- UTF-16 allocations moved outside IPC loop (performance improvement)
- Tray icon ghost on exit

## [1.5.4] - 2024-12-23

### Added
- NANO mode exit hysteresis (require 5 consecutive samples above threshold)

## [1.5.3] - 2024-12-23

### Fixed
- was_nano initialization in tray app

## [1.5.2] - 2024-12-23

### Added
- NANO mode cyan icon and notification to tray app

## [1.5.1] - 2024-12-23

### Changed
- NANO mode: show drift in nanoseconds, lower entry threshold

## [1.5.0] - 2024-12-23

### Added
- NANO mode for ultra-precise sub-microsecond systems
- Single-instance check to dantetray

## [1.4.8] - 2024-12-22

### Added
- BPF filter for PTP packets to reduce DVS conflict

## [1.4.7] - 2024-12-22
